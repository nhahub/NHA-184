Data Analysis Project for DEPI
This repository contains the complete deliverables for my graduation project, which focuses on developing a comprehensive Manufacturing Downtime Analysis Dashboard using Power BI. The project aims to provide a data-driven, automated solution for understanding, monitoring, and reducing downtime across manufacturing operations. By integrating multiple datasets and applying advanced analytics, the dashboard empowers decision-makers to enhance production efficiency, streamline maintenance processes, and minimize operational losses.
The solution is built around data collected from various sources within a manufacturing facility, including maintenance logs, production schedules, equipment performance reports, and cost data. These datasets were cleaned, processed, and modeled to create a unified analytical environment capable of delivering accurate and actionable insights. The dashboard enables users to explore downtime behavior, identify root causes, and evaluate the financial impact of machine failures and process interruptions.
